# OPPORTUNITIES IN COLLEGE <br/>


**“It's through curiosity and looking at opportunities in new ways that we've always mapped our path.” - Michael Dell
<br><br>
PVG COET is home to many opportunities in form of clubs and committees. There are several opportunities for everyone who is interested in tech, entrepreneurship, management, creative fields, etc. These things shape the personality of a student throughout the 4 years of engineering. Also, we get to meet similar minds when we join the clubs, committees and interact with seniors. Take a peek at all the clubs that you can be part of -**<br/>
